## Logo File

**Please save your Wellflex logo here as:**

- **File name:** `wellflex-logo.png` (or `.svg`, `.jpg` if you prefer)
- **Full path:** `/Users/breidercastro/Projects/Time Tracker - Wellflex/public/wellflex-logo.png`

### Supported Formats:
- PNG (recommended) - `wellflex-logo.png`
- SVG - `wellflex-logo.svg`
- JPG - `wellflex-logo.jpg`

### Logo Specifications:
- The logo should be a white "W" on a purple background (as described)
- Recommended size: 200x200px or larger (will be scaled down to 96x96px on the page)
- Transparent background is fine if the logo includes the purple background

The logo will automatically appear on:
- Login page (`/login`)
- Signup page (`/signup`)
- Forgot Password page (`/forgot-password`)
- Reset Password page (`/reset-password`)

If the logo file is not found, the pages will fall back to the default SVG icon.
